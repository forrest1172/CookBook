# CookBook
A simple cookbook web app for my wife
## Tech
### client
- html
- css
- javascript
### Server
- python3
- flask
## Why not node.js?
the webApp is hosted locally on my raspberry pi and can be accessed over the local network so using flask and py3 made sense to me.
My next webapp will be made with node
